# TT 0 Notes
* data structures organize data
    * very algorithmic
    * works w/ algorithms to create programs

* paradigms are strategies/approaches that is followed to write software applications
    * imperative paradigm uses statements to change the state of a program
    * procedural paradigm is a form of imperative programming that splits codes into discrete sections with each one carrying out it's own task (procedures)
    * object oriented paradigms structures programs into classes, which create individual instances of objects

* arrays and hash maps are common data structures seen in both imperative and object oriented paradigms
    * arrays have a set key called the index, which include values from 0 to n-1 (number of values within array) while you can control the key for hash maps and you can make it a number, string or symbol
    * arrays allow for duplicate elements, but hash maps don't allow for duplicate keys (allows for duplicate values)
